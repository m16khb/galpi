# OUTBOUND ADAPTER KNOWLEDGE

## OVERVIEW

OS egress for the Rust host: worker supervision, CPAL capture, WAV persistence,
engine/model staging, path policy, and desktop port implementations. Limits,
cleanup, and stable error codes are the contract here.

## STRUCTURE

## WHERE TO LOOK

| Task | Location |
|------|----------|
| Add a supervised step | `ProcessSpec` in `process.rs`; callers in `setup.rs`, `transcription.rs` |
| Change output bounds | `MAX_LINE_BYTES`, `error_tail` in `process.rs` |
| Change kill escalation | Cancel arms in `process.rs`, Drop in `process/guard.rs` |
| Change capture details | `recording/capture.rs` |
| Change backpressure/RIFF caps | `recording/writer.rs` |
| Change error mapping | `recording/cleanup.rs`, `recording/failure.rs` |
| Change worker variables | `process_environment` in `environment.rs` |
| Change debug/release paths | `uv_binary`, `worker_root` in `paths.rs` |

## CONVENTIONS

- Spawn with `env_clear`, the explicit process environment, null stdin,
  `kill_on_drop`, and a dedicated process group.
- Cancellation sends SIGTERM to the group, waits three seconds, then SIGKILLs.
  The armed guard also SIGKILLs on Drop; normal exits disarm it.
- Protocol stdout is one bounded JSON envelope per line; duplicate completion
  is rejected. Stderr remains logs and its 20-line tail explains failures.
- The CPAL callback only converts samples and `try_send`s bounded chunks.
  Queue saturation is `AUDIO_OVERRUN`; channel loss is `WAV_WRITER_FAILED`.
- The writer thread owns Hound, periodic flushing, and the RIFF 4 GiB guard.
- Record to `.wav.part`; finalize, drain failure state, validate duration, then
  atomically rename. Every failure path removes the partial.
- First failure wins: store and emit one `RecordingFailure`, ignore later ones.
- Offline mode requires all expected model directories and no token.
- Canonicalize worker paths, output roots, artifacts, and cache sources before
  prefix/containment checks.
- Use `spawn_blocking` for synchronous CPAL and filesystem work.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- Do not signal a bare PID or call `child.kill`; use the process-group guard.
- Do not inherit the parent environment or add ad hoc variables at a spawn.
- Do not parse stderr as protocol or permit lines above `MAX_LINE_BYTES`.
- Do not allocate, lock, flush, or block in the audio callback.
- Do not replace `try_send` with a blocking send.
- Do not publish `.wav` before final rename or omit partial-file cleanup.
- Do not trust paths from the worker, model cache, or picker without containment.
- Keep process, recording, path, and model-cache regressions in their existing
  sibling/inline test modules.
